name: Failed logon attempts in authpriv
description: |
  'Identifies failed logon attempts from unknown users in Syslog authpriv logs. The unknown user means the account that tried to log in 
  isn't provisioned on the machine. A few hits could indicate someone attempting to access a machine they aren't authorized to access. 
  If there are many of hits, especially from outside your network, it could indicate a brute force attack. 
  Default threshold for logon attempts is 15.'
