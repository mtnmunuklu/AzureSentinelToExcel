name: SecurityEvent - Multiple authentication failures followed by a success
description: |
  'Identifies accounts who have failed to logon to the domain multiple times in a row, followed by a successful authentication
  within a short time frame. Multiple failed attempts followed by a success can be an indication of a brute force attempt or
  possible mis-configuration of a service account within an environment.
  The lookback is set to 6h and the authentication window and threshold are set to 1h and 5, meaning we need to see a minimum
  of 5 failures followed by a success for an account within 1 hour to surface an alert.'
